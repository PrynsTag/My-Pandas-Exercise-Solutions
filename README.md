# Pandas Exercises

Fed up with a ton of tutorials but no easy way to find exercises I decided to create a repo just with exercises to practice pandas.
Don't get me wrong, tutorials are great resources, but to learn is to do. And copying tutorials won't make you really.

And there will be three different types of files:
1. Exercise instruction
2. Solutions without code
3. Solutions with code and comments

My suggestion is that you learn a topic in a tutorial or video and then do exercises.
Learn one more topic and do exercises. If you got the answer wrong, don't go to the solution with code, follow this [advice](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/FreeCodeCamp-Get-Help) instead.

Suggestions and collaborations are more than welcome. :)
